# Flutter Liveness Detection Randomized Plugin

A Flutter plugin for liveness detection with randomized challenge response method with an interaction mechanism between the user and the system in the form of a movement challenge that indicates life is detected on the face. This plugin helps implement secure biometric authentication by detecting real human presence through dynamic facial verification challenges.
